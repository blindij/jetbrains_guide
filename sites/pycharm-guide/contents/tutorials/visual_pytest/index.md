TODO

- Find places to interlink (tips, outside Python docs)

- Sprinkle in the highlight lines routine a bit more (or see if there's something to include just a snippet)

- Improve the subtitles

Python developers love writing code. Tests? Not so much. Whether itâ€™s the
concepts of testing, or the interface of testing tools, testing is a chasm
not all cross.

This tutorial aims to bring Python testing to the masses, taking a new
approach to first contact with Python testing:

- Visual testing using PyCharm

- Driven by the popular pytest framework

- Real-world scenario during the live building of a simple Python application

- Shows how PyCharm can help you get into testing and development "flow"

*Note: We'll be using PyCharm Community Edition for all the tutorial sections except the part about coverage.*
