- We'll be using PyCharm Community Edition except for section on coverage

- Make a project

- Make a requirements.txt and enter pytest in it

- Minimal setup.py (perhaps using PyCharm)

    - Note: could be skipped by mark source root, but other tools e.g.
      CI would break

- Enable pytest as the test runner

- Make a top-level directory called tests

## Background

- What is pytest

    - Link to Brian's book, RealPython, pytest home page

- What is visual testing

- Links to PyCharm help

- About this scenario

*Note: This tutorial isn't intended to teach Python testing or
[pytest](../../../technologies/pytest). While you don't need to know much, 
you might want to explore the other material.*
