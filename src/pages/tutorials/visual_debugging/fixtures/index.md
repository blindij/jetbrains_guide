Re-usable Data with Fixtures
----------------------------

- First in the file

- Then in conftest.py

- Autocomplete of fixture name

    - Including context-sensitive in arguments, no 'dir'

- Navigation

- Type awareness of the fixture, onhover

- Quick info on fixture argument, don't have to interrupt flow
